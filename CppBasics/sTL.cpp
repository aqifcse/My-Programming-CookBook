/**
Component & Description
1
Containers
Containers are used to manage collections of objects of a certain kind.
There are several different types of containers like deque, list, vector, map etc.
2
Algorithms
Algorithms act on containers. They provide the means by which you will perform initialization,
sorting, searching, and transforming of the contents of containers.
3
Iterators
Iterators are used to step through the elements of collections of objects. These collections
may be containers or subsets of containers.
